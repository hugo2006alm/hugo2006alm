## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hugo, a passionate individual who loves exploring the realms of technology. My interests span across various domains, including IT, cybersecurity, game development, and web/web app development. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you can often find me with a guitar in hand, strumming to the beats of my favorite rock tunes.

## ðŸŽ¸ Music and Me

Rock music is my heartbeat, and I draw inspiration from legendary bands like Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Ornatos Violeta, and Pink Floyd. Whether it's the soulful melodies or the raw energy, music has always been a significant part of my life. I also have a band, Maniacs on Black Sugar (MOBS For short), being the rhythm guitarist in it. If you haven't heard us yet, check out our song "Stay The Night" on YouTube.
